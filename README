Converts all patterns in a Hydrogen song to 4 beats. Useful if you want to use jack transport along with another program such as Qtractor and you have patterns of different lengths.
1) Any pattern larger than 4 beats will be split into patterns of size 4 beats, with names original_file_i for i = 0...n.
2) The original pattern is not deleted.
3) In the sequencer, any instances of a pattern that has been split is replaced by the patterns it is split up into.
